# Exploring AJAX in Web Development

This assignment is designed to introduce you to AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), 
a set of web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous web 
applications. By using AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server 
asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the 
existing page.
